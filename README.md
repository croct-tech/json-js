## Introduction

This library provides types for representing arbitrary data types, both strictly and loosely (JSON-compatible).

## Installation

We recommend using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the package:

```sh
npm install @croct/json
```

## Overview

The types in this library include:

- Types for representing valid JSON values
- Types for representing values that can be safely serialized to JSON using `JSON.stringify()`
- An interface for classes that can serialize to JSON

See the [source code](src/mutable.ts) for more information.

## Contributing

Contributions to the package are always welcome! 

- Report any bugs or issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/croct-tech/json-ts/issues).
- For major changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/croct-tech/json-ts/issues) first to discuss what you would like to change.
- Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Building

Before building the project, the dependencies must be installed:

```sh
npm install
```

The following command builds the library:

```
npm run build
```
